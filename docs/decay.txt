bbDKP decay calculation.

You can decay individual raids, as well as the whole database.
The decay value is a percentage, applied on Effort points, (= Earned raid value + adjustments + time values), 
and on GP (= Item values)
The decay value depends on time passed since the raid, and so a percentage is applied n times on the value of the raid.

mathwise, this is :

Code: Select all
    r = raid value
    n = age of raid in weeks
    i = decay percentage
    d = decay value  = 1- (1-i)^n
    k = raid decay = r * d 

This is based on compound interest calculation.
decay1 = 1 - (1-i)
decay2 = 1 - (1-i) * (1-i)
decay3 = 1 - (1-i) * (1-i) * (1-i)
... and so on.

example :
r = raid value = 200
n = age of raid in weeks = 2
i = decay percentage = 10%
d = decay value = 1- (1-i)^n => 1 - (1-0.1)^2 => 0.19
k = raid decay = r * d => 200 * 0.19 = 38

Raid after decay = 200 - 38 = 162

the same applies to itemcost, i.e gearpoints.
So the PR ratio is unaffected by decay since the nominator and the denominator offset eachother.

In the database there are decay columns in the member dkp table, raid table and item table.

A function exists, accessible in ACP->bbdkp->main settings->"decay", Run now button that recalculates decay for the 
global database (for all pools). Typically, the admin will run the "Run now" decay button periodically.
this will recalculate decay as described above.

It can also be applied per individual raid (button in raid acp).
